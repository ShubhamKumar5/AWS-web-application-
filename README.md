# AWS-web-application-
The web application is designed to receive requests from the internet. Clients can send queries to request specific data. Upon receiving a request, the web application interacts with a MySQL database to fetch the required data and then sends it back to the client.

The AWS region is configured with two Availability Zones to ensure increased availability of web applications for consumers. Each Availability Zone consists of a Public Subnet and a Private Subnet, with EC2 instances in the Public Subnet and RDS (MySQL) instances in the Private Subnet. An Internet Gateway establishes the connection between the client and the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
Clients send HTTP requests to query data, which are then directed to the VPC through the Internet Gateway. The requests reach a load balancer, specifically an Application Load Balancer, as they are sent through a web application that handles HTTP traffic. The load balancer distributes the incoming traffic in a round-robin fashion among the EC2 instances hosted in both Availability Zones.
Auto Scaling groups are attached to the EC2 instances to manage scaling based on incoming traffic from the internet. These EC2 instances are protected by security groups that only allow traffic from the Internet Gateway.
The EC2 instances communicate with the RDS instances, which are hosted in different Availability Zones, to retrieve data from the database. They share the response back to the client through the same channel. The RDS instances are protected by security groups that only accept traffic from the EC2 instances. Auto Scaling groups attached to the database manage scaling based on the fluctuations in EC2 traffic.
In this way, both the availability and scalability of the resources are effectively addressed.
